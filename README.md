# project-Untamo
This is an attempt to create a synchronized alarm clock. 

Currently the web interface and the backend seem to work.

Mobile app is WIP and needs to converted from expo to React Native CLI in the end.



### TODO

 Offline use for the alarms and possibly for the  devices. This  should be fairly straightforward as it should only  mean modifying the state manager and therefore means close to 100 % code share between the mobile and the web interface.



### Project

Backend: NodeJs

Web: TypeScript + React

Mobile: TypeScript + React Native (currently uses expo)
