This is an attempt to create a synchronized alarm clock. 

Currently the web interface and the backend seem to work.

Mobile app is WIP and needs to converted from expo to React Native CLI in the end.



### TODO

 Offline use for alarms and possibly   devices. This  should be fairly straightforward as it should only  mean modifying state manager and therefore means close to 100 % code share between the mobile and the web interface.
